Changes
=======

Case of Text Display
	It uses a lower case character set which I think looks nicer generally. This can be fixed back by changing
			CharacterROMAlt.new.export_include("_char_rom.h")
	in export.rb to
			CharacterROM.new.export_include("_char_rom.h")

CLOAD "xxxx" 
	loads xxxx.vz from either the storage folder under the emulator (PC) or Flash Data Storage (ESP32), and runs it if it is machine code.

POKE 4096,1 
	Engages high speed mode, which is 33Mhz on a PC, and up to 33Mhz on the ESP32, it's probably only slightly quicker in practice.
	This can be useful for very long initialisation times as it has no effect on a real machine.

POKE 4352+c*4+t,n 
	Sets colour c palette entry t to 0-255. ESP32 will approximate it as it is 2 bit colour.
		t = 0 Red 1 Green 2 Blue
		c = 0..7 represent the colours in semigraphics / mode 1
		c = 12..15 are dark/bright green and dark/bright orange for text.

	This is not meant for flashy effects, but to allow a game to nondestructively have a better palette. However, the game should work with the
	default colour scheme, so it still works on a real machine, albeit in the 6847 colour scheme.

Flashing effects 
	caused by changing the mode and thus the colour scheme will work, but only at one change per frame, and on the ESP32 may result in some 
	slowdown because it repaints the whole display.	The same applies to palette effects.

Sound
	The sound is calculated on an average per frame basis, so any PCM efforts will not work.

Split screens
	Any games which change the 6847 mode half way down will not work (and will drive it up the wall).

Issues
	The boot prompt has changed slightly.

	CSAVE does not work at present.

Hardware
	The project should run on any FABGL compatible hardware. The cheapest is a "LilyGo TTGO VGA32" board which are a few pounds and accept PS/2 and VGA connections
	(you will need a USB to PS/2 adaptor to run a USB keyboard). There are several versions, some do not have sound, and some do not have an SDCard socket 
	(this is not currently used). It also has a jack socket not a piezo buzzer or speaker for audio. Not having the sound will not affect program behaviour other than
	(obviously) you won't hear the sound. Which might be a blessing.
